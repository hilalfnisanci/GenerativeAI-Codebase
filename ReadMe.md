# Overview of Generative AI Projects

This repository contains a series of exercises and projects that explore various applications of generative AI, primarily using the OpenAI GPT-4 model. The projects range from introductory concepts to advanced implementations, providing a comprehensive understanding of how generative AI can be utilized in different scenarios.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/hilalfnisanci/GenerativeAI-Codebase.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd GenerativeAI-Codebase
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    **Note:**
    Each folder contains a README file listing the necessary libraries for each exercise. If preferred, you can skip the requirements file and directly install the dependencies for the specific exercise youâ€™re working on by following the instructions in its README file.


## Projects and Exercises Included

To explore these projects and exercises, please review the folders in the listed order below. This will help you progress from foundational concepts to more complex implementations.

1. **Introduction to Generative AI Concepts**: Summarizes the latest advancements in artificial intelligence using the OpenAI GPT-4 model and Langchain library.

2. **Generating Business Ideas**: Utilizes GPT-4 to generate innovative business ideas based on AI technologies, managed through Langchain.
